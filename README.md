Fastest Deliveryman Sdn. Bhd. offers delivery services to its affiliate restaurants at a
                             reasonable fixed fee per delivery. It has a fleet of 361 delivery men on motorcycles in
                             the Klang Valley. Restaurants that want to use this service will sign up as an affiliate of
                             Fastest Deliveryman.
                             In the existing manual system, a customer makes his order by directly calling his
                             selected restaurant. The restaurant will then post a message in the Fastest
                             Deliverymanâ€™s WhatsApp group. A delivery man who is nearby the restaurant will then
                             respond by indicating that he will handle that delivery. When the food is delivered to the
                             customer, the cash payment will be made to the delivery man. At the end of the work
                             day or on the next morning, Fastest Deliveryman will remit the amount due (i.e. the total
                             payment collected minus the delivery fees) accordingly to each of its affiliate
                             restaurants.
